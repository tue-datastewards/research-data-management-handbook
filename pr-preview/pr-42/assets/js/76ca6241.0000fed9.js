Funders increasingly began recognizing the importance of research data management in ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and the long-term impact of research. Many funding organizations have implemented specific requirements and guidelines regarding research data management that researchers must adhere to in order to receive funding. These requirements may vary depending on the funding agency and the type of research being conducted.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"before-research/rdm-costs/rdm-costs":{"id":"before-research/rdm-costs/rdm-costs","title":"Costs of Research Data Management","description":"An important part of the data management plan is to cost the resources needed to implement good research data management practices. Most DMPs include a paragraph on the resources that you plan to dedicate to RDM. These costs can be diverse and include things like people\u2019s time, equipment, infrastructure and tools to manage, document, organise, store and provide access to data. You can find a helpful overview of possible RDM costs per research phase and research activity at the\xa0Utrecht University website. It is based on the data management costing tool developed by the\xa0UK Data Service costing tool\xa0and focuses on the social sciences.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"before-research/reusing-data/reusing-data":{"id":"before-research/reusing-data/reusing-data","title":"(Re)use of existing data","description":"Instead of acquiring new data, it might be more efficient to reuse existing data. This may be data collected by others but also data you collected previously. Reusing research data offers numerous benefits to both individual researchers and the broader scientific community. In general, reusing research data is a practice that benefits researchers by saving time and resources, reducing data redundancy, improving the rigor of research through validation and reproducibility, enabling comparative and interdisciplinary studies, and promoting a collaborative scientific culture and knowledge exchange. Reusing existing data can sometimes be more ethically sound than collecting new data, especially when dealing with sensitive topics or vulnerable populations. It reduces the need to subject participants to additional data collection processes.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"contact":{"id":"contact","title":"Contact us","description":"The data stewards of TU/e Research Data Management can be contacted via rdmsupport@tue.nl or via the contact details below:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"deadlines":{"id":"deadlines","title":"Important Deadlines","description":"Has your project been recently awarded a grant?
