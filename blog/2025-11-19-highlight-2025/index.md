We are approaching the end of 2025! As the Data Steward team, we discussed what is one highlight for our team.

## What was our highlight for 2025?

We had many options, such as installing the [TU/e Research Data Management Framework Policy](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15309046), engaging with the researcher community, enhancing the Research Cockpit... In the end, we decided that making the [Research Data Management Booklet](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15736839) was our highlight for the year!

## Information we submitted as product team highlight 2025

Below is the information about the RDM Booklet project.

### Approach

Three years ago there was an initiative to make an RDM Booklet for newly onboarded researchers, only last year a data steward picked this up again and made all the necessary updates. The Booklet got feedback from all the relevant stakeholders and was sent to the printers in September this year.

### Results

The data steward team developed a booklet to help new students and researchers managing their research data

### Timeline

The initial plan started on 2022, but due to capacity issues it got postponed. In 2025 this project was picked up again and brought to fulfillment this September 2025

### Impact

Early-career researchers are now more aware of RDM and who to ask for support if they need more in-dept help.

### Feedback Received

This booklet has received very positive feedback form early-career researchers that need guidance in RDM. We have been providing these booklets at onboarding events, Research Day, LIS Expo, Responsible Research conversations event, etc.

### Lessons Learned

- Clear communication
- Re-usability of materials
- Visual design skills
- Evaluation of the needs from researchers
- Engaging with all the relevant stakeholders
- Feedback gathering and implementation
