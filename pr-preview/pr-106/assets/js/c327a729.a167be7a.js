As the Data Steward team, we discussed what is one highlight for our team.\\n\\n## What was our highlight for 2025?\\n\\nWe had many options, such as installing the [TU/e Research Data Management Framework Policy](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15309046), engaging with the researcher community, enhancing the Research Cockpit... In the end, we decided that making the [Research Data Management Booklet](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15736839) was our highlight for the year!\\n\\n![Three Research Data Management Booklets standing, with the cover page showing the text, \\"This is RDM\\"](rdm-booklets.png)\\n\\nYou can download the booklet on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15736840\\n\\nIf you want physical copies, please [contact us](/docs/contact).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Information we submitted as product team highlight 2025\\n\\nBelow is the information about the RDM Booklet project.\\n\\n### Approach\\n\\nThree years ago there was an initiative to make an RDM Booklet for newly onboarded researchers, only last year a data steward picked this up again and made all the necessary updates. The Booklet got feedback from all the relevant stakeholders and was sent to the printers in September this year.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nThe data steward team developed a booklet to help new students and researchers managing their research data\\n\\n### Timeline\\n\\nThe initial plan started on 2022, but due to capacity issues it got postponed. In 2025 this project was picked up again and brought to fulfillment this September 2025\\n\\n### Impact\\n\\nEarly-career researchers are now more aware of RDM and who to ask for support if they need more in-dept help.\\n\\n### Feedback Received\\n\\nThis booklet has received very positive feedback form early-career researchers that need guidance in RDM. We have been providing these booklets at onboarding events, Research Day, LIS Expo, Responsible Research conversations event, etc.\\n\\n### Lessons Learned\\n\\n- Clear communication\\n- Re-usability of materials\\n- Visual design skills\\n- Evaluation of the needs from researchers\\n- Engaging with all the relevant stakeholders\\n- Feedback gathering and implementation"},{"id":"welcome-to-rdm-handbook","metadata":{"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-106/blog/welcome-to-rdm-handbook","editUrl":"https://github.com/tue-datastewards/research-data-management-handbook/tree/main/blog/2025-05-01-welcome-to-rdm-handbook/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-01-welcome-to-rdm-handbook/index.md","title":"Welcome to the RDM Handbook!","description":"Welcome to the Handbook!","date":"2025-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"data stewards","permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-106/blog/tags/data-stewards","description":"Topics related to data stewards"}],"readingTime":0.53,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Nami Sunami","title":"Data Steward","url":"https://namisunami.com","page":{"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-106/blog/authors/nsunami"},"socials":{"bluesky":"https://bsky.app/profile/namisunami.com","github":"https://github.com/nsunami","mastodon":"https://mastodon.social/@nsunami@akademienl.social","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nsunami/"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/nsunami.png","key":"nsunami"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome-to-rdm-handbook","title":"Welcome to the RDM Handbook!","authors":["nsunami"],"tags":["data-stewards"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Highlight of Data Steward Team for 2025","permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-106/blog/highlight-2025"}},"content":"Welcome to the Handbook!\\n\\n## Our Mission\\n\\nOur mission as Data Stewards is to help researchers with Research Data Management (RDM) challenges in a collaborative way, while being an advocate of open & responsible scientific practices that transcend TU/e.\\n\\n## What we offer\\n\\n- First-line support for researchers on Research Data Management (RDM), privacy, ethics, and data agreements for researchers\\n- Consultations for workflows related to Data Management & FAIR data\\n- Training and knowledge transfer on RDM, privacy, and associated topics\\n\\n## Get in touch\\n\\nTo contact data stewards, please email [rdmsupport@tue.nl](mailto:rdmsupport@tue.nl).
