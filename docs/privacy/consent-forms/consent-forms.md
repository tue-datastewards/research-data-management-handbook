# Consent Forms

Processing personal data requires a [legal basis](https://tuenl.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet-privacy-security/SitePages/privacy-basis.aspx#legal-bases). For research this typically is TU/e's **public task** (as mentioned in the [FAQ](https://tuenl.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet-privacy-security/SitePages/research.aspx#what-legal-basis-can-i-use-for-processing-personal-data-in-research)).

Nevertheless, participants in research still need to provide (ethical) permission to participate in a research project, and they must be informed about how their personal data will be used. TU/e has designed [**templates**](https://tuenl.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet-privacy-security/SitePages/consent-forms.aspx) that address both personal data processing and ethical permission requirements. We highly recommend using these templates in your research. The forms can be integrated into online surveys. Make sure you use the latest version of the templates since they are updated on a regular basis. Please note that the participants of the research should be able to understand the content of consent forms. This means that while choosing a correct template you need to select one that is compatible with participants' language comprehension (Dutch and/or English).

Typically, the forms include an information sheet which explains the overall project and purpose for personal data collection. It is important to describe the goal of the data collection and envisaged use of the personal data, also in future research. The use of data is limited to the specific processing and purpose described in the form and no use outside those areas is permitted. Do you have multiple purposes for processing data? If so, you must inform the data subject about this. The purpose may not change along the way.

Permission can be given by signature, digital signature, check mark or even verbally recorded (the latter for example in online interviews that are recorded). For children under the age of 16, it is necessary that the parent/guardian gives consent (this may differ per EU country).

If you need help with completing the informed consent template or have any questions please contact [**a data steward**](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/library/library-for-researchers-and-phds/research-data-management/contact-a-data-steward).
