The information in the data package should correspond to the information in the article that reports the results. Other researchers should be able to replicate your study independently and solely based on this information. The information should be concise yet as complete as possible. Your data package should include the following: A README or instruction file which lists the files inside the package and explains their relation and includes a step-by-step instruction on how to use the files to replicate the study.Raw data files. If your study is based on a portion of the original dataset, include only the necessary data.

Thus, it is important to properly archive your research output. Archiving data means that you ensure that a copy of your dataset is kept in a secure location for the long term (10 years or more).  Research data is all information, digital and non-digital, generated as part of the scientific process, on which scientific conclusions are based. In the research data lifecycle, it is important to differentiate between the stage where data is actively undergoing analysis (referred to as mutable data) and the phase where research data has been processed and has reached a stable state (known as immutable data). A similar differentiation is also applicable to storage and archiving systems, as they entail distinct functional and technical prerequisites.  Deciding which research data to archive involves careful evaluation of different factors to ensure that valuable and relevant data are preserved for future use. Here's a step-by-step process to help you make informed decisions about archiving research data:  Define Archiving Goals and Criteria  Identify the purpose of archiving: Is it for research integrity, future reference, data sharing, reproducibility, or compliance with funding or institutional requirements? (See in the table below which files need to be saved for the purpose of research integrity and reuse of data.)Determine the criteria for data selection: Consider factors such as data quality, significance, uniqueness, potential for reuse, and alignment with your research objectives.  Assess Data Value and Significance  Evaluate the importance of the data to your research outcomes and conclusions.Consider the potential value of the data to other researchers, disciplines, or future studies.Prioritize data that underpin published findings or have the potential to contribute to new insights.  Consider Ethical and Legal Considerations  Ensure that the data to be archived comply with ethical standards, privacy regulations, and data protection laws.Anonymize or de-identify sensitive or personal information as necessary.Obtain necessary permissions or consents for data sharing and archiving, especially for human subjects data.  Assess Data Quality and Documentation  Ensure that the data are well-documented, properly organized, and adequately described.Include metadata that provide context, methods, variables, and any relevant information for understanding the data.  Evaluate Reusability and Reproducibility  Choose data that can be easily understood and reused by others, facilitating reproducibility and validation.Consider whether the data and associated documentation are sufficient to replicate your research methods and findings.  Select Data with Long-Term Value  Focus on data that have enduring relevance, regardless of current trends or specific project timelines.Prioritize data that contribute to broader scientific knowledge and have the potential for continued impact.  Include Raw and Processed Data  Whenever possible, archive both raw and processed data, as well as any intermediate results or transformations.Raw data enable others to apply different analyses and methods, while processed data showcase your research approach.  Consider Data Granularity  Decide whether to archive comprehensive datasets or subsets that are most relevant to specific research questions or areas.  Involve Collaborators and Stakeholders  Discuss data archiving decisions with co-authors, collaborators, or other stakeholders to ensure a shared understanding and agreement.  Document Archiving Decisions  Maintain clear records of the data archiving process, including the rationale for selecting or excluding specific datasets.  Use Data Repositories  Choose reputable data repositories that align with your field of research and offer appropriate metadata and access options.  Review and Update  Regularly review and update your archiving decisions to ensure they align with evolving research goals and practices.  Two factors come into play when determining the data to be archived at a minimum: the motivation to preserve data for research integrity and the desire to facilitate data sharing among fellow researchers.

Raw data are the original data that you have collected but have not yet processed or analysed. For instance: audio files, archives, observations, field notes and data from experiments. Data you have not collected yourself and that you are reusing, may be considered raw data. Processed data are the data that you have digitised, translated, transcribed, cleaned, validated, checked and/or anonymised. Analysed data are the models, graphs, tables, texts and so on that you have created based on the raw and the processed data, and that are intended to aid in the discovery of useful information, the presentation of conclusions, and decision-making  Does TU/e have an archive for research data?

While these repositories differ in their options for restricted access and, for example, size of data storage, the type of data you want to deposit should be considered.  Before uploading your data into a repository, make sure that you data is suitable for making them openly available. For example, datasets containing personal data or (privacy-)sensitive data require additional attention. They may be published for example under restricted access, or only a description or metadata of the data with an explanation on how the data can be shared. You can also check Re3data.org for an overview of data repositories or contact the Data Stewards (rdmsupport@tue.nl) for a tailored advice.  4TU.ResearchData A Dutch repository for research data initiated by the Dutch technological universities (Eindhoven, Delft, Twente). The repository has received the Data Seal of Approval (guaranteeing long-term storage) and provides restricted access options and flexibility in license choice. Datasets generally come from the fields of engineering and technology but are open to all sciences, are stored in the Netherlands for a minimum of 15 years and are assigned a DOI. Researchers affiliated to the universities of technology in Eindhoven can deposit up to 100 GB of data per year free of charge, where for larger datasets there is a one-off cost of €3/GB (for 15 years storage), which is covered by the TU/e. 4TU.ResearchData can also be synced with your GitHub account.  Please check the demo video to learn how to use the 4TU.ResearchData repository software.  Zenodo A European initiative providing a data repository for research data from all fields. Zenodo can also be connected to GitHub, enabling code citation from GitHub (https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/). The repository allows for restricted access and a choice from a variety of licenses. Datasets are stored within the EU, are preserved for a minimum of ten years, and assigned a DOI. Research data up to 50 GB can be stored for free, but deposition of larger datasets must be negotiated.  When choosing a repository for your data, be sure to think of the criteria the repository needs to meet in terms of your data, funders and journal editors (e.g. assigning a DOI, adding adequate metadata, and being able to select a license). You can ask your peers if they know discipline-specific repositories that are commonly used in your field of research but make sure these repositories meet your criteria.

Pure is the source system for registration of all forms of TU/e research output, including research data. Please note that Pure is intended for the registration of records of datasets or data collections. Do not use Pure to archive the actual data. The actual data must be deposited in a data repository. If you have not done this yet, please do this first.  In many cases, your research data will be part of or be related to other research output (for example, a journal publication or the underlying research data published in a data repository). In Pure you can easily link research output that is related to each other or part of a larger project. At the bottom of the registration form, a field called Relations to other content is shown; this allows you to link research datasets to papers, book chapters, a PhD or master thesis, etc. The exact details on how to do this are explained here.  For further questions about repositories or registering your dataset in Pure, please contact the Data Stewards (rdmsupport@tue.nl).  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"FAQ​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Data Repository","url":"/docs/after-researcch/data-repository/#faq","content":" Does TU/e have its own data repository to deposit research data? Yes, that’s 4TU.ResearchData. It’s co-developed by TU Delft, University of Twente and TU/e.  Is it mandatory to use 4TU.ResearchData to deposit my research data at the end of the project? No, if there is a good alternative in your scientific discipline, we advise you to use it. See this short overview or go to re3data.org to find a suitable repository.  How can I upload my data sets in 4TU.ResearchData? Go to 4TU.ResearchData, select TU/e at Institutional account, log in with your TU/e credentials, fill out the upload form, and attach your data files to the form. You can find instructions here. You can also check the demo video to learn how to use the 4TU.ResearchData repository software.  Are there any costs involved in uploading datasets in 4TUResearchData? For TU/e staff, the use of 4TU.ResearchData is free up to 100 GB per year per researcher. For example, if you are working on a project with three colleagues, each of you can upload 100 GB of data, in total 300 GB. If your data exceeds this limit, please contact rdmsupport@tue.nl.  Is my dataset immediately online once I have uploaded it? No, your data set and accompanying description will first be reviewed. You will be informed whether or not your dataset is approved. This will take approximately three working days.  A while ago I published a dataset in 4TUResearchData and now I would like to mention the article that belongs to the dataset. Is that possible? Yes, that’s possible and you can do this yourself (for more info see this). You can also reserve a data-DOI in the upload form of the repository. Do not publish your dataset yet. You can use this data-DOI in your manuscript. The data-DOI will be activated once you publish the dataset online. If at that point you have the DOI of your article, you can include this in the metadata section of the submission. This will complete the circle: the article-DOI is referenced in the metadata of the dataset, the data-ROI is referenced in the article.  I just published a dataset with 4TU.ResearchData and I discovered a serious mistake in a data file. Can I remove or change my dataset? It is not possible to remove the dataset entirely. You are allowed to modify your published dataset. The modified version will receive a new DOI. The original DOI of the published dataset will always take you to the latest version of the item. For more info see this.  What is a DOI? A DOI is not a URL. A DOI is a unique number that identifies a digital object on the internet (a publication, a data set, etc.) regardless of where the object is located on the internet (URL). This means that if the URL of the object changes, the object can still be found using the DOI.

Without a license, all rights remain with the author of the code, meaning that nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify the software without permission. A license provides the permissions to use the software under well-defined conditions, so always license your software if you want to share it. Licensing generally increases, not decreases, the openness of your software.  It is important to choose a license early, in particular when the development of the software is a collaborative effort. If no license is in place on time, a collaborator will hold copyright on each new contribution and will thus need to be asked for an approval when a license is chosen. Often, you also need to consider your licensing strategy in your Data Management Plan (DMP). It is recommended to add a LICENSE.txt file in the source directory of your software, or to mention add the license at the beginning of your code. That way you make sure that your license is visible to others.  If further questions about data or software licenses remain, then please contact the data stewards of the RDM support team.

Since they are not appropriate for software, a special software license should be used.  First of all, when selecting a software license, it is important to determine who owns the research software you wrote. If you wrote the software as a part of your employment at TU/e, it is important to consult with Innovation Lab to discuss any issues of ownership and intellectual property protection (particularly if patenting of the software is under consideration).  If your software has dependencies or incorporates other people’s work, make sure that your software’s license is compatible with the licenses of the software it depends on. For example, you cannot use MIT on top of GPL. You should also decide whether you require others who modify your software to release it under a compatible license.  Some recommended licenses are:  MIT License - a permissive license that allows users to do almost anything with the software, including using it in proprietary projects, as long as the original license is included in the distribution.Apache license - similar to the MIT License, but it includes a patent grant, offering some protection against patent litigation.GNU General Public License (GPL) - allows the user to do whatever they want with the software, including modify and sell it, provided that they also give that right to others and mention the author(s) of the software.

The university guidelines regarding data storage will be adhered to (and discussed with data stewards as necessary). During the active phase of the project, only the researchers involved in the project will have access to the storage folder. Clear folder structure with consistent file naming will be used. Data stored on TU/e recommended solutions is backed-up daily to multiple secure and geographically diverse locations to avoid data loss. External data sharing will be done securely via SURFfilesender. Example sentence II: SURF Research Drive (sharing with external parties required) For data storage and sharing during the active research phase, project members will use the SURF Research Drive platform. SURF Research Drive is a national cloud service in the Netherlands designed for storing, synchronizing, and sharing files related to research projects, with a particular emphasis on research data sharing with external collaborators. This platform is hosted and technically managed by SURF in the Netherlands, is ISO 27001 certified, and complies with the SURF Baseline Information Security. Data in Research Drive is encrypted both at rest and during transfer. Collaborators and other consortium members can be granted access to the TU/e instance of Research Drive using their organizational email address with multifactor authentication. For handling highly confidential data, TU/e members will use the encryption tool Cryptomator Hub, which ensures secure data sharing1. Example sentence III: TU/e Network Drive (sharing with external parties not required) During the active research phase, TU/e members will use the TU/e Network Drive for data storage. Technical IT measures ensure only authorized TU/e staff and privileged accounts can access and process data. The system includes ransomware protection, critical vulnerability scanning, a next-generation firewall, data back-up, disaster recovery, and server-side encryption. The primary storage location is a data center with ISO 27001 certification, built to Tier 4 standards for maximum reliability. Furthermore, TU/e has implemented a strategic information security policy based on the NIST framework. The TU/e security organization undergoes the SURFaudit and includes a Chief Information Security Officer, an operational security team, a Computer Emergency Response Team (available during office hours), and a 24/7 Security Operations Center with SIEM capabilities.

It refers to descriptive information about a project's documentation and data, making it easier to locate, understand, and manage. Metadata includes attributes such as project title, authors, creation date, keywords, geo location as well as attached licenses. Proper metadata enhances searchability, categorization, and retrieval of project documents and datasets. Metadata is an intrinsic element of the FAIR principles because it provides information that enables the (future) user or computer to find the data and understand what the dataset entails. Without metadata, reuse and reproducibility are impossible. Unlike documentation, metadata should be machine-readable.  In short, metadata:  Explains data provenance, detailing how, when, and where data was created.Aids others in understanding your data's context.Increases data findability with unique identifiers like DOI and indexed keywords.  Metadata standards  Defining appropriate metadata depends on the discipline and/or the methodology that was used to produce the data. There are already multiple standards available for different fields of research: FAIRsharing.org provides an extensive catalogue of standards used in biomedical research. Metadata Standards Catalog includes metadata standards for various subjects and disciplines. You can ask your peers which metadata standard is commonly used in your domain. Enriching your data with additional domain-specific metadata will make it more useful and findable for others.

When you deposit your data in these two repositories, you will be asked to provide this type of metadata.  A generally accepted minimum standard for describing information on the web, including research data, is Dublin Core. Further information on this metadata standard is available at: Dublin core.

It provides a hierarchical structure that includes Section Groups (this could be a research project), Sections (this could be the Methods section) and Pages (e.g., a Page in the Methods section could describe details of the apparatus you used in your study). OneNote allows for handwritten or typed notes, video and audio recordings, diagrams, images, drawings, screen clippings, equations, etc. An ELN in OneNote can easily be shared through platforms such as MS Teams or MS OneDrive and can be opened on different devices (laptops, smartphones, etc.).

Think of how you are going to arrange your research data (and other research-related documents) in folders and subfolders right from the start of your project. An arrangement in 3 layers will usually do. Try to avoid more layers. Ways to arrange your data files into folders may be by file type, method (e.g. interview, survey, experiment, observation) or type of material (e.g. data, documentation, publications). It is beneficial to capture your chosen folder structure in a README file or in a diagram for a visual representation.  Good practices for folder structure:  Your folder structure must still make sense to you when you return from holiday. It should also make sense to your colleagues and should be machine-operable.A simple folder structure on a Windows machine could look like something like this:  projectName ├── README.txt ├── rawData │ └── myData.csv ├── processing │ ├── importableDatafiles │ │ └── myDataCopy.csv │ ├── code │ │ ├── importData.py │ │ ├── analyseData.py │ │ └── createFigure.py │ └── output │ ├── resultRQ1.csv │ ├── figureRQ1.png │ ├── resultRQ2.csv │ └── figureRQ2.png ├── documents │ └── codebook.csv └── temp └── tempData.csv   Explanation: README includes an overview of the files in the folder./rawData contains the input data. The content of this folder should remain untouched./importableDatafiles contains a working copy of the original data./code contains the code files./output contains the final output files that provide content for your paper. Consider creating a new subfolder for your figures./documents may contain codebooks, metadata files, the manuscript, etc./temp is where you can save temporary or intermediate files. Use relative path names in your code or define your paths at the top of the script. This will make it easier for someone else to use your code.

For example, when you are working with many collaborators on a project, it can be difficult to keep track of the latest version, or to work on a document simultaneously. Solutions, such as using Git for version management, can be useful for these projects. Moreover, separate ongoing and complete work: identify milestone or master versions which cannot be altered or deleted and thus decide which versions to keep, for how long and how to organize them.  Good practices for version management:  Remove non-relevant versions.Work with easy to manage number versions.Keep working versions separately from master versions.Make a table with all changes per version described.Use Git.

Together with appropriate data organization, such as clear folder structure and adding sufficient metadata to facilitate re-use of your data, there are various ways to warrant research data safety. Main safe storage facilities supported by TU/e are:    TU/e Network drives (Primary research storage solution) Departments and research groups can request their collective group folders which staff members have access to. These folders can be used for sharing research data with other TU/e researchers. Network drives are suitable for the storage of regular and special category of personal data as well as any type of confidential data. Data on TU/e network drives are backed up daily and copies (snapshots) are retained for 30 days. For further information or requests, please contact LIS (lisservices@remove-this.tue.nl). OneDrive (Your own personal TU/e storage) A cloud storage service for data storage and sharing, hosted by Microsoft. Datasets are stored on servers in Europe. Each TU/e member has access to a personal storage of 1TB space, accessed via TU/e account. Data can be easily shared with other researchers with a Microsoft account, both within and outside TU/e (for collaboration on a project, check Research Drive or Sharepoint options below). Data can also be shared with guest users or external parties via a “share link” functionality. OneDrive can be used to store normal personal data. Contact your Data Steward in case you are going to store sensitive or special personal data.  Note: Upon leaving the university, your personal OneDrive account and all its content will be deleted. If you have project data that others (within your research group/colleagues) may need or your results will be included in a publication, make sure to transfer them into a shared storage, such as Network drive, before your departure from TU/e.  SURF Research Drive (External collaboration storage – preferable) A cloud storage service that allows data storage, synchronization, and secure sharing of data within research projects. Research Drive is hosted by SURF and storage space on Research Drive is allocated on a project basis instead of a personal basis, entailing that data storage can be maintained after a researcher has left TU/e. Research Drive can provide scalable storage space, with back-ups/disaster recovery and allows setting access rights. The data are stored in the Netherlands and can be shared with TU/e researchers and researchers from other universities and institutes (also abroad). If you are planning to store, special category personal data please contact your Data Steward. Further information on Research Drive can be found on the Research Drive page on SURF User Knowledge Base and on the Research Cockpit.Teams/SharePoint (External collaboration storage – alternative) With Teams and SharePoint you have additional functionalities for team collaboration and organization wide communication on top of the OneDrive storage. Teams and SharePoint sites can store up to 2.5TB of data. If more storage is needed, contact LIS Services.  To get an overview of storage solutions offered and supported by TU/e, visit PAR Solution Searcher. If you are in doubt, please contact your Data Steward.  Note that additional security measures are needed when you store or share special category personal data. For example, you may require client-side encryption if using a storage solution other than TU/e Network drives. For further information, please consult a Data Steward.  Storing data on personal computers or mobile hard disks or USBs is discouraged due to irregular back-ups and the high potential for loss of the data. Storing data in cloud services outside the EU (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud or private (i.e., without TU/e credentials) OneDrive) should also be avoided because of possible non-compliance with the GDPR.

TU/e has designed templates that address both personal data processing and ethical permission requirements. We highly recommend using these templates in your research. The forms can be integrated into online surveys. Make sure you use the latest version of the templates since they are updated on a regular basis. Please note that the participants of the research should be able to understand the content of consent forms. This means that while choosing a correct template you need to select one that is compatible with participants' language comprehension (Dutch and/or English). Typically, the forms include an information sheet which explains the overall project and purpose for personal data collection. It is important to describe the goal of the data collection and envisaged use of the personal data, also in future research. The use of data is limited to the specific processing and purpose described in the form and no use outside those areas is permitted. Do you have multiple purposes for processing data? If so, you must inform the data subject about this. The purpose may not change along the way. Permission can be given by signature, digital signature, check mark or even verbally recorded (the latter for example in online interviews that are recorded).

The GDPR applies from May 25, 2016, and has been enforced since May 25, 2018. The GDPR is valid throughout the European Union (EU). The GDPR requires you, as a researcher, to provide clarity and transparency to data subjects (i.e., participants in your study) about how you handle and process personal data. Moreover, it demands that certain safeguards and security measures will be put in place to protect the privacy of data subjects.  GDPR defines ‘personal data’ as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’). Personal data also includes data that indirectly reveal something about a natural person. Personal data can lead to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of a natural person. However, data of deceased persons or organizations are not considered to be personal data because they are not natural persons. There are different types of personal data: normal personal data and special category personal data (see figure below).    The usage of special category personal data in research requires extra security measurements in order to safeguard the privacy of data subjects and to comply with the GDPR. Processing of this special category personal data is prohibited, except for specific purposes and un/@der certain circumstances. If you need to process special category data, please consult the data stewards of the RDM support team.  The Privacy Team of TU/e has published an FAQ on the GDPR.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Processing Personal Data​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Privacy","url":"/docs/privacy/privacy/#processing-personal-data","content":" Processing personal data in research should be done with caution and should include measures that are important to safeguard the privacy and rights of your data subjects. Consider the following:  Work safely With personal data, it is particularly important to work safely. Do not leave printouts on the printer or desk, do not use public Wi-Fi, do not work where others can easily watch your screen or hear you talk, do not leave you laptop logged in when you are away, etc.  Apply data minimization Collect as little personal information as possible and necessary for your research.  Work with de-identified data Personal data can either be anonymized (data cannot (under any circumstances) be traced back to a person) or pseudonymized (no immediate identification, but it remains possible to identify a person from the data with additional information). Up until the anonymization takes place, the data is still personal data (not anonymized). Consequently, in these cases data subjects should not be informed that the survey is anonymous (this erroneously happens often).  The anonymization process aims at irreversibly preventing the identification of an individual study participant. It is quite a challenging process, which involves the use of complicated and ever-changing techniques, such as randomization, generalization or masking. Which type of techniques works best depends on the situation. For the data to be considered truly (i.e., effectively and sufficiently) anonymized, all direct identifiers (such as name, address, telephone number, email address) and all indirect identifiers (such as age, place of birth, occupation, education, income) need to be irreversibly altered in such a way that a data subject can no longer be directly or indirectly identifiable either by the data controller alone or in collaboration with any other party.  If you are not sure whether your data is completely anonymized or you have questions about the anonymization process contact the data steward of your department for help.  Pseudonymization: replacing any identifying characteristic(s) of a data subject with an artificial pseudonym, or in other words, a value which does not allow the data subject to be directly identified. This means that identification is still possible with the identification key. The identification key must be stored securely and separately from the pseudonymized data. If the data subject can be identified by combining data with additional information, the data is also called pseudonymous. Privacy laws do apply to pseudonymized data. You can find more information about pseudonymization here.  Encryption: if it is not feasible to de-identify the data, encrypting data is also an option. Encryption makes data unreadable or inaccessible to those without a password. The data file itself can be encrypted or the drive, where the data file is located, can be encrypted.  Ensure storage limitation Store personal data for no longer than is necessary for your research purposes. Do not store or distribute unnecessary copies of the data. Store identifiable information apart from other information. To comply with the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, de-identified data should be kept for a period appropriate to the respective discipline and methodology.  For storage options, check PAR Solution Searcher, discuss the most suitable storage with your supervisor, or contact a data steward or Research IT consultant.  Restrict access In case of collaboration, define who has access collected data, how you will restrict this, how you will enable access to those authorized, and where you will describe who gets access to the data. Do not share or keep the data in a form which permits identification of data subjects for any longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.  Be prepared for data subject (i.e., study participants) requests Respondents should be able to successfully invoke their data subject rights within four weeks if the study includes their personal data. For example, the right to:  a rectification of their personal data;have their data erased;access the data that is being processed on them.a restriction on the usage of their data;  If you receive formal data subject requests that you cannot handle within four weeks, please consult your data steward and the privacy team via privacy@tue.nl.  Processing agreement If you engage other parties to process personal data (a processor) on behalf of your organization then you must record agreements about that processing of personal data in an agreement (in writing, may also be electronic). Topics that are covered in a processing agreement are: general description of the project, confidentiality, security, compliance with the GDPR, privacy rights, etc. More information and a template can be found here.

You do not have to perform a DPIA for every data processing operation. A DPIA is only mandatory for projects involving the processing of personal data and if data processing is likely to pose a high privacy risk to data subjects. To assess if your data processing has a significant risk to the privacy of others you first need do a pre-DPIA scan. A pre-DPIA is a short questionnaire that determines how high the risk is when processing personal data from a project and whether a more extensive DPIA is needed and what measures you need to take to ensure the privacy of data subjects. You can find FAQ about DPIA on the Privacy page.  In any case, you have a high risk if you:  follow people on a large scale and systematically in publicly accessible areas; (for example with camera surveillance).Process special personal data on a large scale.systematically and extensively evaluate personal aspects (including profiling).  Data stewards can help you with assessing the risks associated with your data processing and can give you advice on privacy, GDPR, and ethical issues before starting your research. They can also support you and provide advice on completing DPIA template.  Make sure that you regularly review data processing and privacy risks during your research. These risks may change and therefore the security measures you had planned need to be reviewed and updated accordingly.
